## Overview

-----------------
On the OverTheWire/Bandit website, we are told how connecting to the bandit server as a specific user works.

Each user corresponds to a different level:
- Bandit0 -> Level 0
- Bandit1 -> Level 1
- ...
- Bandit33 -> Level 33

Each level is hiding a flag, which is used as the password for the following level. Meaning, one must solve `Level n` to play `Level n+1`.

We always start out connecting to the `bandit.labs.overthewire.org` server on `port 2220` for each level.
Again, the users on the server specifies the level. Each starting point is the same:

``` commandline
┌──(francis㉿ghost)-[~]
└─$ ssh bandit{level}@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
                         _                     _ _ _   
                        | |__   __ _ _ __   __| (_) |_ 
                        | '_ \ / _` | '_ \ / _` | | __|
                        | |_) | (_| | | | | (_| | | |_ 
                        |_.__/ \__,_|_| |_|\__,_|_|\__|
                                                       

                      This is an OverTheWire game server. 
            More information on http://www.overthewire.org/wargames

bandit{level}@bandit.labs.overthewire.org's password: 
```

The password will always be the flag of the previous level.


## Connecting

--------------

We can establish a connection with the server via ssh, and using the password `EN632PlfYiZbn3PhVK3XOGSlNInNE00t`:

``` commandline
┌──(francis㉿ghost)-[~]
└─$ ssh bandit9@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
                         _                     _ _ _   
                        | |__   __ _ _ __   __| (_) |_ 
                        | '_ \ / _` | '_ \ / _` | | __|
                        | |_) | (_| | | | | (_| | | |_ 
                        |_.__/ \__,_|_| |_|\__,_|_|\__|

Welcome to OverTheWire!

bandit9@bandit:~$ 
```

## Task

--------------

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt in one of the few human-readable strings, preceded by several ‘=’ characters.


## Looking Around

--------------
We first start by looking around the home directory, as we have no idea what is going on. We will use the command `ls`,
which allows us to `list` the content of the current directory (or specified directory).

``` commandline
bandit9@bandit:~$ ls
data.txt
```

Let's print the head of the file via the `head` command.

``` commandline
bandit9@bandit:~$ head data.txt

Alright, so there is a lot of garbage in this file. In the task we were given a hint that the flag is preceded by a bunch of "=" characters.

However, we can clearly see from the `head` command that we are dealing with bytes, perhaps unprintable bytes and some printable characters.
We can use the `strings` command, which ONLY prints ASCII characters.

- `strings` - print the sequences of printable characters in files

``` commandline
bandit9@bandit:~$ strings data.txt
B4Qle
x<9s
f`	W0
?`YOd45
Iiuv
|S5j
...
<snip>
...
o+Ma
>ZOx
*x!g
5fV^{g-u
(?@1
```

Okay, we have a lot of strings with printable characters. We know we can use `grep` to go through each line and find lines with certain patterns.
More specifically, we know from the task that our flag is preceded by a bunch of "=" characters.

We can use the output of `strings data.txt` and pipeline it into the `grep` command. Additionally, we will use "==" because,
the task says "multiple", which means at least two "=" are preceding.

``` commandline
bandit9@bandit:~$ strings data.txt | grep "=="
4========== the#
========== password
========== is
========== G7w8LIi6J3kTb8A7j9LgrywtEUlyyp6s
```

It appears we are given a hint regarding which one of the lines contains the password. We can safely assume that `G7w8LIi6J3kTb8A7j9LgrywtEUlyyp6s`
is the password.

Boom we got the flag.
