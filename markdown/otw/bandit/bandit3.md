## Overview

-----------------
On the OverTheWire/Bandit website, we are told how connecting to the bandit server as a specific user works.

Each user corresponds to a different level:
- Bandit0 -> Level 0
- Bandit1 -> Level 1
- ...
- Bandit33 -> Level 33

Each level is hiding a flag, which is used as the password for the following level. Meaning, one must solve `Level n` to play `Level n+1`.

We always start out connecting to the `bandit.labs.overthewire.org` server on `port 2220` for each level.
Again, the users on the server specifies the level. Each starting point is the same:

``` commandline
┌──(francis㉿ghost)-[~]
└─$ ssh bandit{level}@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
                         _                     _ _ _   
                        | |__   __ _ _ __   __| (_) |_ 
                        | '_ \ / _` | '_ \ / _` | | __|
                        | |_) | (_| | | | | (_| | | |_ 
                        |_.__/ \__,_|_| |_|\__,_|_|\__|
                                                       

                      This is an OverTheWire game server.

bandit{level}@bandit.labs.overthewire.org's password: 
```

The password will always be the flag of the previous level.


## Connecting

--------------

We can establish a connection with the server via ssh, and using the password `aBZ0W5EmUfAf7kHTQeOwd8bauFJ2lAiG`:

``` commandline
┌──(francis㉿ghost)-[~]
└─$ ssh bandit3@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
                         _                     _ _ _   
                        | |__   __ _ _ __   __| (_) |_ 
                        | '_ \ / _` | '_ \ / _` | | __|
                        | |_) | (_| | | | | (_| | | |_ 
                        |_.__/ \__,_|_| |_|\__,_|_|\__|

## Looking Around

--------------
We first start by looking around the home directory, as we have no idea what is going on. We will use the command `ls`,
which allows us to `list` the content of the current directory (or specified directory).

``` commandline
bandit2@bandit:~$ ls
inhere/
```

Okay, it seems like `inhere` is a directory. Let's change directory to `inhere` and check out what's in there.

``` commandline
bandit3@bandit:~$ cd inhere
bandit3@bandit:~/inhere$ ls
bandit3@bandit:~/inhere$ 
```

It seems like the directory is empty. However, let's use the same flags we used for the last level to check the files in the directory.

``` commandline
bandit3@bandit:~/inhere$ ls -la
total 12
drwxr-xr-x 2 root    root    4096 Apr 23 18:04 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root    root    4096 Apr 23 18:04 ..
-rw-r----- 1 bandit4 bandit3   33 Apr 23 18:04 .hidden
```

Using the `-l` flag and the `-a` flag, we were able to "uncover" all the files that are in the directory. As we can see,
there is a file names `.hidden` which is probably the one we are looking for. Let's print its contents.


``` commandline
bandit3@bandit:~/inhere$  cat .hidden
2EW7BBsr6aMMoJ2HjW067dm8EgX26xNe
```

Boom. We got another flag. Since there are no weird prefixes in the filename, we don't need to use `quotes`.
