## Overview

-----------------
On the OverTheWire/Bandit website, we are told how connecting to the bandit server as a specific user works.

Each user corresponds to a different level:
- Bandit0 -> Level 0
- Bandit1 -> Level 1
- ...
- Bandit33 -> Level 33

Each level is hiding a flag, which is used as the password for the following level. Meaning, one must solve `Level n` to play `Level n+1`.

We always start out connecting to the `bandit.labs.overthewire.org` server on `port 2220` for each level.
Again, the users on the server specifies the level. Each starting point is the same:

``` commandline
┌──(francis㉿ghost)-[~]
└─$ ssh bandit{level}@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
                         _                     _ _ _   
                        | |__   __ _ _ __   __| (_) |_ 
                        | '_ \ / _` | '_ \ / _` | | __|
                        | |_) | (_| | | | | (_| | | |_ 
                        |_.__/ \__,_|_| |_|\__,_|_|\__|
                                                       

                      This is an OverTheWire game server. 
            More information on http://www.overthewire.org/wargames

bandit{level}@bandit.labs.overthewire.org's password: 
```

The password will always be the flag of the previous level.


## Connecting

--------------

We can establish a connection with the server via ssh, and using the password `tQKvmcwNYcFS6vmPHIUSI3ShmsrQZK8S`:

``` commandline
┌──(francis㉿ghost)-[~]
└─$ ssh bandit29@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
                         _                     _ _ _   
                        | |__   __ _ _ __   __| (_) |_ 
                        | '_ \ / _` | '_ \ / _` | | __|
                        | |_) | (_| | | | | (_| | | |_ 
                        |_.__/ \__,_|_| |_|\__,_|_|\__|

Welcome to OverTheWire!

<snip>

bandit28@bandit:~$ 
```

## Task

--------------

There is a git repository at ssh://bandit29-git@localhost/home/bandit29-git/repo via the port 2220. 
The password for the user bandit29-git is the same as for the user bandit29.

Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.

## Looking Around

--------------
We first start by looking around the home directory, as we have no idea what is going on. We will use the command `ls`,
which allows us to `list` the content of the current directory (or specified directory).

``` text
bandit29@bandit:~$ ls
bandit29@bandit:~$
```


Alright same procedure as last level. Let's use this command: `git clone ssh://bandit29-git@localhost:2220/home/bandit29-git/repo`

``` text
bandit29@bandit:~$ mktemp -d
/tmp/tmp.fhqQNqwTAz
bandit29@bandit:~$ cd /tmp/tmp.fhqQNqwTAz
bandit29@bandit:/tmp/tmp.fhqQNqwTAz$ git clone ssh://bandit29-git@localhost:2220/home/bandit29-git/repo

Hmm. No commit mistakes. Maybe there are other branches we can check out. 

``` text
bandit29@bandit:/tmp/tmp.ru1AYL07Ll/repo$ git branch -a
* master
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/dev
  remotes/origin/master
  remotes/origin/sploits-dev
```

Alright. Perhaps they made a mistake in the development and can check the files/commits there. So, let's switch to the
`remotes/origin/dev` branch.


``` text
bandit29@bandit:/tmp/tmp.ru1AYL07Ll/repo$ git checkout remotes/origin/dev
Note: switching to 'remotes/origin/dev'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

  git switch -c <new-branch-name>

Or undo this operation with:

  git switch -

Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

HEAD is now at 13e7356 add data needed for development
bandit29@bandit:/tmp/tmp.ru1AYL07Ll/repo$
```

Alright. Let's first check the `README.md` file again. 

``` text
bandit29@bandit:/tmp/tmp.ru1AYL07Ll/repo$ cat README.md

Oh. We got the password right here. Awesome. Another flag.
