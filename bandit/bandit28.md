## Overview

-----------------
On the OverTheWire/Bandit website, we are told how connecting to the bandit server as a specific user works.

Each user corresponds to a different level:
- Bandit0 -> Level 0
- Bandit1 -> Level 1
- ...
- Bandit33 -> Level 33

Each level is hiding a flag, which is used as the password for the following level. Meaning, one must solve `Level n` to play `Level n+1`.

We always start out connecting to the `bandit.labs.overthewire.org` server on `port 2220` for each level.
Again, the users on the server specifies the level. Each starting point is the same:

``` commandline
┌──(francis㉿ghost)-[~]
└─$ ssh bandit{level}@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
                         _                     _ _ _   
                        | |__   __ _ _ __   __| (_) |_ 
                        | '_ \ / _` | '_ \ / _` | | __|
                        | |_) | (_| | | | | (_| | | |_ 
                        |_.__/ \__,_|_| |_|\__,_|_|\__|
                                                       

                      This is an OverTheWire game server. 
            More information on http://www.overthewire.org/wargames

bandit{level}@bandit.labs.overthewire.org's password: 
```

The password will always be the flag of the previous level.


## Connecting

--------------

We can establish a connection with the server via ssh, and using the password `AVanL161y9rsbcJIsFHuw35rjaOM19nR`:

``` commandline
┌──(francis㉿ghost)-[~]
└─$ ssh bandit28@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
                         _                     _ _ _   
                        | |__   __ _ _ __   __| (_) |_ 
                        | '_ \ / _` | '_ \ / _` | | __|
                        | |_) | (_| | | | | (_| | | |_ 
                        |_.__/ \__,_|_| |_|\__,_|_|\__|

Welcome to OverTheWire!

<snip>

bandit28@bandit:~$ 
```

## Task

--------------

There is a git repository at ssh://bandit28-git@localhost/home/bandit28-git/repo via the port 2220. 
The password for the user bandit28-git is the same as for the user bandit28.

Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.

## Looking Around

--------------
We first start by looking around the home directory, as we have no idea what is going on. We will use the command `ls`,
which allows us to `list` the content of the current directory (or specified directory).

``` text
bandit28@bandit:~$ ls
bandit28@bandit:~$
```

Alright same procedure as last level. Let's use this command: `git clone ssh://bandit28-git@localhost:2220/home/bandit28-git/repo`

``` text
bandit28@bandit:~$ mktemp -d
/tmp/tmp.ZOqC6jcY1u
bandit28@bandit:~$ cd /tmp/tmp.ZOqC6jcY1u
bandit28@bandit:/tmp/tmp.ZOqC6jcY1u$ git clone ssh://bandit28-git@localhost:2220/home/bandit28-git/repo

# Bandit Notes
Some notes for level29 of bandit.

## credentials

- username: bandit29
- password: xxxxxxxxxx
```

Alright. So we apparently have a `README` file, which contains, or perhaps used to contain, a password. I assume that
we have to go through the different commits of the file and check if we can find some previous commit which contains
the password.

We can use the `git log -p` command which shows the commit logs. The `-p` flag is used to show the **patch information** for
each commit. The `patch` information displays what changes were made between commits in a `diff` style display. 
This is useful for understanding not only the metadata about the commit (like the author, date, and commit message) 
but also the actual lines of code that were added or removed.

As we can see, `Ben Dover` (Lol) created the file, and put a `<TBD>` for the password. Then `Morla Porla` updated the file
and put in the password for `bandit29`. `Morla Porla` apparently realized her mistake and ended up x-ing out the
password.

So, the password for `bandit29` is `tQKvmcwNYcFS6vmPHIUSI3ShmsrQZK8S`.
