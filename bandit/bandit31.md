## Overview

-----------------
On the OverTheWire/Bandit website, we are told how connecting to the bandit server as a specific user works.

Each user corresponds to a different level:
- Bandit0 -> Level 0
- Bandit1 -> Level 1
- ...
- Bandit33 -> Level 33

Each level is hiding a flag, which is used as the password for the following level. Meaning, one must solve `Level n` to play `Level n+1`.

We always start out connecting to the `bandit.labs.overthewire.org` server on `port 2220` for each level.
Again, the users on the server specifies the level. Each starting point is the same:

``` commandline
┌──(francis㉿ghost)-[~]
└─$ ssh bandit{level}@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
                         _                     _ _ _   
                        | |__   __ _ _ __   __| (_) |_ 
                        | '_ \ / _` | '_ \ / _` | | __|
                        | |_) | (_| | | | | (_| | | |_ 
                        |_.__/ \__,_|_| |_|\__,_|_|\__|

            More information on http://www.overthewire.org/wargames

bandit{level}@bandit.labs.overthewire.org's password: 
```

The password will always be the flag of the previous level.


## Connecting

--------------

We can establish a connection with the server via ssh, and using the password `OoffzGDlzhAlerFJ2cAiz1D41JW1Mhmt`:

``` commandline
┌──(francis㉿ghost)-[~]
└─$ ssh bandit31@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
                         _                     _ _ _   
                        | |__   __ _ _ __   __| (_) |_ 
                        | '_ \ / _` | '_ \ / _` | | __|
                        | |_) | (_| | | | | (_| | | |_ 
                        |_.__/ \__,_|_| |_|\__,_|_|\__|

Welcome to OverTheWire!

<snip>

bandit31@bandit:~$ 
```

## Task

--------------

There is a git repository at ssh://bandit31-git@localhost/home/bandit31-git/repo via the port 2220. 
The password for the user bandit31-git is the same as for the user bandit31.

Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.

## Looking Around

--------------
We first start by looking around the home directory, as we have no idea what is going on. We will use the command `ls`,
which allows us to `list` the content of the current directory (or specified directory).

``` text
bandit31@bandit:~$ ls
bandit31@bandit:~$
```

Alright same procedure as last level. Let's use this command: `git clone ssh://bandit31-git@localhost:2220/home/bandit31-git/repo`


``` text
bandit31@bandit:~$ mktemp -d
/tmp/tmp.e2CVTe2phP
bandit31@bandit:~$ cd /tmp/tmp.e2CVTe2phP
bandit31@bandit:/tmp/tmp.e2CVTe2phP$ git clone ssh://bandit31-git@localhost:2220/home/bandit31-git/repo

This time your task is to push a file to the remote repository.

Details:
    File name: key.txt
    Content: 'May I come in?'
    Branch: master

```

Interesting. So we are given instructions on what to do. We are supposed to push a file named `key.txt` to the branch
`master` with the contents `May I come in?`. So, let's do exactly that.


``` text
bandit31@bandit:/tmp/tmp.e2CVTe2phP/repo$ echo "May I come in?" > key.txt
bandit31@bandit:/tmp/tmp.e2CVTe2phP/repo$ ls
key.txt  README.md
bandit31@bandit:/tmp/tmp.e2CVTe2phP/repo$ rm .gitignore 
```

Note that we removed the `.gitignore` file as well.

``` text
bandit31@bandit:/tmp/tmp.e2CVTe2phP/repo$ git add "key.txt"

BOOM. We got another flag.
